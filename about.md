The Commission for Women is an appointed body to advise the Chancellor on the planning, implementation, and evaluation of university programs, policies, and services designed to improve the status of women on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee. You can learn more [about the Commission here](http://cfw.utk.edu/about/) 

The STEM Committee is a special committee of the Commission that advises the commission on important issues related to the representation and opportunities of women in the sciences, technology, engineering, and math fields. Comprised of undergraduate and graduate students, the STEM Committee also has an important role in outreach and advocacy among students to raise awareness of how students of all backgrounds can get involved - males included. 

The STEM Committee is actively looking to recruit new members into the general body as board positions have recently been filled, so if you or anyone you know is interested, please fill out the form below. Males that are interested in issues of access and diversity are also encouraged to join; the committee currently has 3 and is looking to add more as well.
