## Bethany Aden

I grew up in a small town (McKenzie, TN) where I always found math and science interesting. I had an anatomy torso doll, Dr. Aden lab coat, a microscope, and I loved collecting rocks. Not only did I find these subjects fascinating but they were also my best subjects in school. Once I entered UTM, one of UT Martinâ€™s statistics was a student will change their major 6 times before graduating. I did not want to be another statistic, so I stayed an undeclared major until I chose what I wanted to do once I grew up, and Chemistry and Cell and Molecular Biology it was. Not only did I enjoy school but I also became fond of research where I conducted research with Mr. Mike Stockdale as part of the TWRA Forensic Lab. Now I am a fourth year polymer chemistry graduate student at The University of Tennessee where I am studying the synthesis and structural properties of biomaterial-functionalized polymer scaffolds. I have also become a member and involved with the Commission for Women: STEM committee. This is an important committee to me because I want to belong to a group that not only represents women in STEM but also supports other women and their goals they are trying to accomplish with research and leadership. It is important to raise awareness of diversity and equality in the STEM community.
