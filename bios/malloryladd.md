## Mallory Ladd, Chair 

When I first got into science, and started hearing the conversation about how “it’s tougher for women in STEM fields”, I thought “No way! I’m in control of my own success, nothing and no one is holding me back. I can do anything the boys can do.” 

When I got to grad school, I started to realize that discrimination against women in STEM isn’t a single, obvious, “slap-in-the-face” experience that only happens to a select few (link, numbers get worse in grad school). 

Instead, I quickly learned that the discrepancy in numbers between men and women in STEM is a systemic problem based on cultural and social attitudes deeply engrained in our society. 

It’s not due to ‘biological differences’ as some will inevitably still try to argue (link), and maybe more surprisingly, it’s also not fully explained by women leaving the field to care for a family (link). 

Instead, there is now empirical evidence (AAUW report) showing that it's the collection of seemingly small, unconscious, daily incidences of discrimination and bias that have led to a lack of diversity in STEM. 

Can you imagine what our world would be like today if at the beginning of science, we welcomed all minds, from all backgrounds, with countless differing perspectives, into each of the STEM fields as they were developed?  

The more research I read about issues concerning women in STEM, and the more stories I hear from countless women across all disciplines, the more I think about this 'what if' scenario. That’s why I decided to join the Commission For Women and start a committee specifically focused on the status and representation of female undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in the 50+ STEM fields we have here at UT. Maybe we can change the future of science at UT. In order to succeed in our quest to become Top 25, we have to.  

As chair of the STEM Committee, my goals for this year are to:

1. increase the conversation and awareness around issues of bias or discrimination of women in STEM fields across campus 

2. provide professional development opportunities, career contacts, and a forum for social interaction to the women in STEM on campus and to the members of the committee, and 

3. enable the cooperation and continued success of our growing team of women and allies at the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty levels.
