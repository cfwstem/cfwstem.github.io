Lauren Brown, Finance Officer

I am originally from upstate South Carolina. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at Wofford College in May 2011. While at Wofford, I become extremely interested in organic chemistry, so I decided to work on research under the guidance of Prof. Caleb Arrington and Prof. Charles Bass investigating asymmetric Diels Alder reactions. After Wofford, I worked at Milliken & Company in Application Development as a technical lab specialist for the Performance Colorants and Additives division before deciding to pursue my Ph.D. in chemistry.

I have worked persistently over the years to promote science in the local community by planning and volunteering for numerous outreach programs. As a graduate student, I have mentored several undergraduate researchers and participated in UTKâ€™s Pre-Collegiate Scholars program were I directed a local high school student in the lab in order to promote graduate school as an educational opportunity. Working to advocate future intellectual endeavors and recognizing successful, innovative research of women in the STEM areas is a continual venture for me so being a part of the CFW STEM Committee has been a wonderful place to endorse these objectives to the undergraduate and graduate communities at the University of Tennessee.
